    <title>Avoid The Falling Spikes!</title>

    <h1>Avoid The Falling Spikes!</h1>

    <p>In this game your task is to avoid the spikes falling from the sky, they will never stop falling and will continue falling until you hit one. <br>Your goal is to survive for as long as you can while gaining points over time, points are given once the game starts. The game itself is pretty basic, taking around a week to complete (if my memory is correct). I had a pretty good time making this game, though, getting the spikes to randomly spawn at the top was a little difficult to get working. The controls are simple, use your cursor to move the character left and right in order to dodge the falling spikes. The following pictures are taken from the game, the photo on the left is the main menu for the game and the photo on the right is a screenshot taken while playing the game.</p>
